\begin{activity}\label{A:0.1.3}
An apartment manager keeps careful record of the rent that he charges as well as the
number of occupied apartments in his complex.  The data that he has is shown in the table
below.  
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Monthly Rent & \$650 & \$700 & \$750 & \$800 & \$850 & \$900 \\
        \hline
        Occupied Apartments & 203 & 196 & 189 & 182 & 175 & 168 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\item Just by doing simple arithmetic justify that the function relating the number of occupied
    apartments and the rent is linear.
\item Find the linear function relating the number of occupied apartments to the rent.
\item If the rent were to be increased to \$1000, how many occupied apartments would the
    apartment manager expect to have?
\item At a \$1000 monthly rent what net revenue should the apartment manager expect?

        \item Recall what we know about slope on a linear function.
        \item Use the point slope form of the line.  You should have found the slope in
            part (a).
        \item Use your answer to part (b).
        \item How do you get the accumulated payments from all of the tenants?
   \ea

\begin{bighint}
   \ba
        \item Check that the slope is constant.
        \item Use the first two points in the point slope form of the line.
        \item Once you have the linear function from part (b), substitute \$1000 in for
            the rent.
        \item We are looking for the rent accumulated by all of the tenants.

   \ba
        \item The slope is 
            \[ m = \frac{196-203}{700-650} = -\frac{7}{50} \]
            and this slope is consistent no matter which pairs of points we choose.
        \item Let $A$ be the number of occupied apartments and let $R$ be the rent.  The
            linear function relating the number of occupied apartments and the rent is
            \[ A - 203 = -\frac{7}{50} \left( R - 650 \right). \]
            Solving for $A$ we get
            \[ A(R) = -\frac{7}{50} \left( R - 650 \right) + 203. \]
            This is a perfectly acceptable algebraic form for the answer, but if you
            insist on simplifying then
            \[ A(R) = -\frac{7}{50} R + 294. \]
        \item $A(1000) = -\frac{7}{50} \left( 1000 - 650 \right) + 203 = 252$ units
            occupied.
        \item The net revenue is the product of the monthly rent and the number of units
            occupied at that rent.  In this case the revenue is $\$1000 \cdot 252 =
            \$252,000$.
