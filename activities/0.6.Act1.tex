Power functions and exponential functions appear somewhat similar in their formulas, but behave differently in many ways.  

\ba
% \begin{itemize}
	\item Compare the functions $f(x)=x^2$ and $g(x)=2^x$ by graphing both functions in several viewing windows.  Find the points of intersection of the graphs.  Which function grows more rapidly when $x$ is large?
    \item Compare the functions $f(x)=x^{10}$ and $g(x)=2^x$ by graphing both functions in several viewing windows.  Find the points of intersection of the graphs.  Which function grows more rapidly when $x$ is large?
	\item Make a conjecture: As $x\to\infty$, which dominates, $x^n$ or $a^x$?
	\item Suppose you are offered a job that lasts one month.  You have the option of being paid in one of two ways: (1) One million dollars at the end of the month; or (2) One cent on the first day of the month, two cents on the second day, four cents on the third day, and, in general, $2^{n-1}$ cents on the $n^{th}$ day.  Which option should you choose?
	\item How much different (shorter or longer) would the work period need to be for your answer to the previous question change?
