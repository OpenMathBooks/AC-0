\begin{activity}\label{A:0.2.2}
    A sample of $Ni^{56}$ has a half-life of 6.4 days.  Assume that there are 30 grams
    present initially.
    \ba
        \item Write a function describing the number of grams of $Ni^{56}$ present as a
            function of time.  Check your function based on the fact that in 6.4 days
            there should be 50\% remaining.
        \item What percent of the substance is present after 1 day?
        \item What percent of the substance is present after 10 days?
    \ea
\end{activity}
\begin{smallhint}
   \ba
        \item The growth rate should be $1/2$.
        \item Figure out how much is there after 1 day and divide by the original amount.
        \item Figure out how much is there after 10 days and divide by the original amount.
   \ea
\end{smallhint}
\begin{bighint}
   \ba
        \item When you substitute $6.4$ for the time you should have decayed by exactly
            half.
        \item Figure out how much is there after 1 day and divide by the original amount.
        \item Figure out how much is there after 10 days and divide by the original amount.
   \ea
\end{bighint}
\begin{activitySolution}
   \ba
        \item $A(t) = 30 \left( \frac{1}{2}  \right)^{t/6.4}$
        \item $A(1) =  30 \left( \frac{1}{2}  \right)^{1/6.4} \approx 26.9206$ so the
            percent that remains is just shy of 90\%.
        \item $A(10) =  30 \left( \frac{1}{2}  \right)^{10/6.4} \approx 10.1569$ so the
            percent that remains is about 33.9\%.
