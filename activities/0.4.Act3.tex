\begin{activity}\label{A:0.4.3}
    Consider the following equation:
	\[
		7^{x} = 24
	\]

	\ba
		\item How many solutions should we expect to find for this equation?
		\item Solve the equation using the log base 7.
		\item Solve the equation using the log base 10.
		\item Solve the equation using the natural log.
		\item Most calculators have buttons for $\log_{10}$ and $\ln$, but none have a button for $\log_{7}$. Use your previous answers to write a formula for $\log_{7}x$ in terms of 					$\log x$ or $\ln x$.

    \item We expect 1 solution since the exponential function $7^x$ is always increasing.
    \item $\log_7 (24) = x$.
    \item $\log (7^x) = \log(24)$ so $x\log(7) = \log(24)$ and therefore $x =
        \frac{\log(24)}{\log(7)}$
    \item $\ln (7^x) = \ln(24)$ so $x\ln(7) = \ln(24)$ and therefore $x =
        \frac{\ln(24)}{\ln(7)}$
    \item $\log_7(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(7)} = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(7)}$.
