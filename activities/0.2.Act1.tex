        \item If the common ratio is larger than 1 what will happen to the $y$ values?
            For example, if the common ratio were 2 and we start with 5 then what would
            the next value be?
        \item If the comon ratio is less than 1 what will happen to the $y$ values?
        \item Do some experimentation to determine which ones will be steeper or less
            steep.

        \item If we start with 5 and the common ratio is 2 then the next value would be
            10, then 20, then 40, etc.
        \item If we start with 5 and the common ratio is $1/2$ then the next value would
            be $5/2$, then $5/4$, then $5/8$, etc.
        \item The exponential growth functions that grow fastest have the larger common
            ratio.
