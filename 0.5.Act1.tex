\item What is the amplitude of the oscillations?  % 30 volts
\item What is the period of the oscillations? % about 0.017 seconds
\item What is the average value of the voltage?  % 20 volts
\item What is the shift along the $t$ axis, $t_0$?  % about 0.008 seconds
\item What is a formula for this function?  %  V(t) = 30 \sin( 2\pi / 0.017 ( t - 0.008) ) + 20
