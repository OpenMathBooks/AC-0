<p>The number of hours of daylight varies sinusoidally throughout the year. The maximum occurs on the summer solstice, June 21, when we have 15 hours and 50 minutes of daylight. The minimum occurs on the winter solstice, December 21, when we have only 8 hours and 33 minutes of daylight. Find the formula for a function to describe this. The input to your function should be \(d\text{,}\) the number of days since the beginning of the year, so that \(d = 5\) on January 5. The output of your function should be the amount of daylight, in minutes. Assume that this is not a leap year. Hint: Because we know the date of maximum, it is easier to write this in terms of a cosine function.</p>
