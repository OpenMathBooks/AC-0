<p>Euler's number, \(e\text{,}\) shows up so often that we give a special name to the associated logarithm. The logarithm \(\log_e (x)\) is called the natural logarithm and is written as \(\ln(x)\text{.}\) We will see later in this course that the exponential function \(f(x) = e^x\) has very special calculus properties and as such the natural logarithm has very special properties as well. With this in mind, most mathematicians and scientists use \(e^x\) and \(\ln(x)\) as their preferred exponential and logarithmic functions.</p>
