<p>You probably first learned about sines, cosines, and tangents when you were studying triangles. However, these functions are amazingly useful in an enormous variety of contexts. These functions are so handy that scientists and mathematicians always keep them in mind as part of our standard toolbox. We use sines and cosines whenever we see anything that varies in a smooth wave cycle, going up and down by the same amount, again and again on a regular basis.</p>
