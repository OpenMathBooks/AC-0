<li>
<p>This function clearly has two roots and the ends show the same behavior. This indicates that this is likely a degree 2 polynomial (a quadratic).  Based on the roots \(x=-2\) and \(x=1\) the factors are \((x+2)\) and \((x-1)\) so the polynomial is of the form \(a(x) = C(x+2)(x-1)\text{.}\)  Finally, it appears that the point \((-1,-4)\) is on the curve so \(C=2\) and the polynomial is</p>
\begin{equation*}
a(x) = 2(x+2)(x-1).
\end{equation*}
</li>
<li>
<p>This function clearly has three roots and the ends show the opposite behavior.  Since the right-hand side of the function tends down we expect a negative leading coefficient.  Based on the roots \(x=-2\text{,}\) \(x=1\text{,}\) and \(x=3\) the factors are \((x+2)\text{,}\) \((x-1)\text{,}\) and \((x-3)\) and the polynomial takes the form \(b(x) = C(x+2)(x-1)(x-3)\text{.}\)  The point \((-1,-8)\) appears to be on the graph so \(C = -1\) and the polynomial is</p>
\begin{equation*}
b(x) = -(x+2)(x-1)(x-3).
\end{equation*}
</li>
<li>
<p>This function clearly has three roots but the end behavior indicates an even degree polynomial.  The root at \(x=1\) is special since we do not cross the \(x\) axis.  Hence, the factors are \((x+1)\text{,}\) \((x-1)\text{,}\) \((x-1)\text{,}\) and \((x-2)\text{.}\)  Notice that the \((x-1)\) root is listed twice, and hence the polynomial takes the form \(c(x) = C(x+1)(x-1)^2(x-2)\text{.}\)  The point \((0,-2)\) appears to be on the graph so \(C = 1\) and the polynomial is</p>
\begin{equation*}
c(x) = (x+1)(x-1)^2(x-2).
\end{equation*}
