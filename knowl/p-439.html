<p>Sines, cosines, and tangents are very useful when studying triangles. The input into each of these functions is an angle, and the output tells us the ratio of the lengths of the sides of the triangle. There are two commonly used units for measuring angles, degrees and radians, and so there are two commonly used versions of the trigonometric functions. There's \(\sin x\) where \(x\) is in degrees, and there's \(\sin x\) where \(x\) is in radians. Calculus is a lot easier if we measure angles in radians, so that's what we'll use throughout this course. If you ever have trouble getting the right numbers from your calculator, you may want to double check that your calculator is in radian mode.</p>
