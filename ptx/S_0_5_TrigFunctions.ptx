      You probably first learned about sines, cosines, and tangents when you were studying triangles. However, these functions are amazingly useful in an enormous variety of contexts. These functions are so handy that scientists and mathematicians always keep them in mind as part of our standard toolbox. We use sines and cosines whenever we see anything that varies in a smooth wave cycle, going up and down by the same amount, again and again on a regular basis.

        A tall water tower is swaying back and forth in the wind. Using an ultrasonic ranging
        device, we measure the distance from our device to the tower (in centimeters) every two
        seconds with these measurements recorded below.

    <title>Measuring Angles with Radians</title>
    <p>
      Sines, cosines, and tangents are very useful when studying triangles. The input into each
      of these functions is an angle, and the output tells us the ratio of the lengths of the
      sides of the triangle. There are two commonly used units for measuring angles, degrees
      and radians, and so there are two commonly used versions of the trigonometric functions.
      There's <m>\sin x</m> where <m>x</m> is in degrees, and there's <m>\sin x</m> where <m>x</m> is in radians.
      Calculus is a lot easier if we measure angles in radians, so that's what we'll use
      throughout this course. If you ever have trouble getting the right numbers from your
      calculator, you may want to double check that your calculator is in radian mode.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what is a radian?
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>radian</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A radian is a measure of angle which is defined so that if we have an angle with
          a size of one radian on a unit circle (with a radius <m>r= 1</m>), then the length of the
          arc along the circumference of the circle is also equal to one, as we see in <xref ref="fig_0_5_radian">Figure</xref>. Because the circumference of a circle is <m>2 \pi r</m>, this means
          that for one complete circle,
          <me>
            360^\circ = 2 \pi \text{ radians. }
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarly half a circle is
          <me>
            180^\circ = \pi \text{ radians }
          </me>
          and a right angle is
          <me>
            90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ radians. }
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          So one radian is
          <me>
            57.3^\circ \approx \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 1 \text{ radian } .
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <figure xml:id="fig_0_5_radian" >
      <caption>Common radian measures.</caption>
      <image width="90%" source="images/0-5-fig2" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Because we define the radian in this way, this means that the arc length <m>s</m> along the
      circumference of a circle with radius <m>r</m> over angle <m>\theta</m> can be calculated as <m>s = r
      \theta</m> as long as the angle <m>\theta</m> is measured in radians.
    </p>

      <caption>Arc length, angle, and radius on a circle.</caption>
      <image width="30%" source="images/0-5-fig3" />
    </figure>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Sine and Cosine on the Unit Circle</title>
    <p>
      Let's draw a unit circle with its center at the origin and think about a point moving along the circumference of this circle. We start with the point on the <m>x</m> axis with coordinates (1,0), as shown in the figure below, and define this location to be an angle of <m>\theta = 0</m> radians. Then, we let this point move up, so that our point is at an angle <m>\theta</m> above the <m>x</m> axis. The sine and cosine functions are defined so that they give us the coordinates of our point:
      <me>
        x = \cos \theta  \text{ and }   y = \sin \theta
      </me>
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_0_5_unit" >
      <caption>Sine and cosine on a unit circle.</caption>
      <image width="40%" source="images/0-5-fig4" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      This means that an angle of <m>\theta = 2 \pi</m> carries us around one full circle and brings
      us back to our starting point on the <m>x</m> axis again, with coordinates (1,0). That means
      that <m>\sin 2 \pi = \sin 0 = 0</m>. Similarly <m>\theta = 4 \pi</m> carries us around two full
      circles, and <m>\theta = 6 \pi</m> carries us around three full circles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next we can use the Pythagorean Theorem, and remember that our hypotenuse is equal to one to see that
      <me>
        \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a very useful relationship!
    </p>

    <activity xml:id="A_0_5_1">
      <p>
        In this activity we will review the trigonometry of the special angles <m>0^\circ</m>,
        <m>30^\circ</m>, <m>45^\circ</m>, and their multiples.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use the fact that <m>180^\circ</m> is the same as <m>\pi</m> radians, convert each of
              the following angle measurements to radians.

              In part (a) of this problem there are several patterns that can help in
              remembering the radian conversions for certain angles.  For example, you
              should have found that <m>30^\circ</m> converts to <m>\frac{\pi}{6}</m> radians.
              Therefore, <m>60^\circ</m> should be twice <m>\frac{\pi}{6}</m> which indeed it is:
              <m>60^\circ = \frac{\pi}{3}</m> radians.  What other similar patterns can you find?
              What is the minimum number of radian measures that you need to memorize?

    <title>Sine and Cosine as Functions</title>
    <p>
      To get beyond trigonometry, rather than using the angle <m>\theta</m> as the input to our sine
      and cosine functions, instead we will put our function input on the <m>x</m> axis. Then we can
      plot the output of on the <m>y</m> axis. This produces the following graph:
      <image width="85%" source="images/0-5-fig5" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Here we can see that the range (output) of the sine function is the interval from <m>-1</m> to
      <m>+1</m>. (<m>\sin x</m> can never equal 2!) The domain (input) of the sine function is extends
      from <m>-\infty</m> to <m>+\infty</m>, but the cycle repeats every <m>2 \pi</m> along the <m>x</m> axis. (Do
      you understand how the definition of sine on the unit circle makes both of these facts
      true?)
    </p>

    <p>
      The following terms will be very important when we describe functions like this:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <em>period</em> of a function is how far along the <m>x</m> axis it takes to complete one full cycle.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The <em>amplitude</em> of a function is how far it goes on the <m>y</m> axis above and below its average value.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The function <m>f(x) = \sin x</m> has a period of <m>2 \pi</m> and an amplitude of <m>1</m>. If we plot
      both the sine and the cosine functions together we see the following graph:
      <image width="85%" source="images/0-5-fig6" />
      From this we see that the function <m>g(x) = \cos x</m> also has a period of <m>2 \pi</m> and an
      amplitude of <m>1</m>. The difference is that <m>\sin 0 = 0</m>, so the sine function starts at its
      average value, halfway between a peak and a trough. On the other hand <m>\cos 0 = 1</m>, so
      the cosine function starts at a peak. This means that we can turn a cosine function into
      a sine function and visa versa simply by shifting:
      <me>
        \sin(x) = \cos \left( x - \frac{\pi}{2} \right)  \text{ and }   \cos(x) = \sin
        \left( x + \frac{\pi}{2} \right).
      </me>
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Sinusoidal Functions in the Real World</title>
    <p>
      To model real data with the sine function, we must be able to change the amplitude, the
      period, and the average value of our wave, to get what we call a <em>sinusoidal</em>
      function. Every sinusoidal function can be written either of these two forms:
      <me>
        f(t) = A \sin( B ( t - t_0) ) + C \mbox{ or }  f(t) = A \sin( B t + \phi) + C
      </me>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>A</m> is the amplitude.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>B</m> is the angular frequency, which determines the period, with <m>B = \frac{2 \pi}{\mbox{Period} }</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>C</m> is the average value.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>t_0</m> is the shift along the <m>t</m> axis, a time when <m>f</m> is at an average value and increasing
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\phi</m> is the shift in radians, the angle at which the oscillations begin
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The parameter <m>B</m> can be a little surprising. Because <m>B</m> is inversely related to the
      period, this means that larger values of <m>B</m> result in a shorter period, and smaller
      values of <m>B</m> result in a longer period, as we see in the graphs below:
      <image width="99%" source="images/0-5-fig7" />
      <image width="99%" source="images/0-5-fig7b" />
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we measure the temperature every hour throughout a day and find that <m>T</m> varies in
          a smooth sinusoidal pattern. We find that the average temperature is <m>60^\circ</m>, the
          amplitude is <m>20^\circ</m>, and the period is 24 hours. The minimum temperature is at 4am,
          the maximum temperature is at 4pm, and so it is at the average temperature and increasing
          at 10am. How would we model the temperature as a sinusoidal function?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      Given the information above we could model these temperatures with the following formula:
      <me>
        T(t) = 20 \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{24} (t - 10) \right) + 60.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      A graph of the function looks like this:
      <image width="50%" source="images/0-5-fig8" />
      Notice that the maximum temperature is <m>80^\circ</m> and the minimum temperature is
      <m>40^\circ</m>. We could tell this directly from the formula, because output of the sine
      function varies between <m>-1</m> and <m>+1</m>, and this is multiplied by 20. As a result, the
      most we ever add to 60 is 20 to get a maximum temperature of 80, and the most we ever
      subtract from 60 is 20, to get a minimum temperature of 40.

    <title>The Tangent Function</title>
    <p>
      The tangent function has a completely different shape than the sine and cosine functions because it is defined to be
      <me>
        \tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}
      </me>
      as long as <m>\cos \theta \neq 0</m>, so that we don't have a divide-by-zero problem. This
      means that the tangent function is undefined at <m>\pm \pi/2, \pm 3 \pi/2, \cdots</m>, and the
      function has vertical asymptotes at these points.
      <image width="80%" source="images/0-5-fig11" />
      Because the tangent function blows up to infinity, we don't often fit tangent functions to real world data.
    </p>

    <title>Inverse Sine, Cosine, and Tangent Functions</title>
    <p>
      Suppose we want to find the value of <m>x</m> so that <m>\sin x = 0.75</m>. To find this, we use an
      inverse sine function, written as either <m>\arcsin</m> or <m>\sin^{-1}</m>. In this case
      <m>\sin^{-1} 0.75 \approx 0.848</m>, because <m>\sin 0.848 \approx 0.75</m>. The range of the sine
      function only goes from <m>-1</m> to <m>+1</m>, so that means the domain of <m>\arcsin</m> only goes from
      <m>-1</m> to <m>+1</m>. It is impossible to find a solution to <m>\sin x = 3</m>, because the sine
      function doesn't go that high!
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to remember that the sine function repeats itself in the same pattern
      again and again, every <m>2\pi</m>, so <m>x = 0.848</m> is not the only solution to <m>\sin x = 0.75</m>.
      Another solution is <m>x = 0.848 + 2 \pi \approx 7.13</m>. Another solution is <m>x = 0.848 + 4
      \pi \approx 13.4.</m>. And of course we could subtract multiples of <m>2 \pi</m> as well to get
      <m>x = 0.848 - 2 \pi \approx -5.44</m>. As a result, we have the <m>\arcsin</m> function output the
      value between <m>-\pi/2</m> and <m>+\pi/2</m>. This means that the arcsine function has a very
      limited domain and range, only existing for <m>-1 \leq x \leq 1</m> and <m>-\pi/2 \leq y \leq
      \pi/2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Warning: Even though we write the inverse sine function as <m>\sin^{-1} x</m>, it is a completely different thing than <m>1 / \sin x</m>.
      <me>
        \sin^{-1}x \neq \frac{1}{\sin x}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can define a similar inverse function for the cosine, which we call <m>\arccos</m> or
      <m>\cos^{-1}</m>. The domain of this function is <m>-1 \leq x \leq 1</m>, and we choose the range
      to be <m>0 \leq y \leq \pi</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recall that the tangent function has a range going all the way from negative infinity to
      positive infinity, as <m>x</m> goes from <m>-\pi/2</m> to <m>+\pi/2</m>. As a result, the inverse
      tangent function has a domain of <m>-\infty \lt  x \lt  \infty</m>, and a range of <m>-\pi/2 \leq y
      \leq \pi/2</m>. The three primary inverse trigonometric functions are shown in <xref ref="F_0_5_inverse_trig">Figure</xref>.

            The number of hours of daylight varies sinusoidally throughout the year. The
            maximum occurs on the summer solstice, June 21, when we have 15 hours and 50 minutes
            of daylight. The minimum occurs on the winter solstice, December 21, when we have
            only 8 hours and 33 minutes of daylight. Find the formula for a function to describe
            this. The input to your function should be <m>d</m>, the number of days since the
            beginning of the year, so that <m>d = 5</m> on January 5. The output of your function
            should be the amount of daylight, in minutes. Assume that this is not a leap year.
            Hint: Because we know the date of maximum, it is easier to write this in terms of a
            cosine function.
