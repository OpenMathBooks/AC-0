      Polynomial functions play an important role in mathematics. They are generally simple to compute (requiring only computations that can be done by hand) and can be used to model many real-world phenomena. In fact, scientists and mathematicians frequently simplify complex mathematical models by substituting a polynomial model that is "close enough" for their purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we will study the graphs of select polynomial and rational functions to identify their important features. The goal of this section is to build a mathematical intuition about how a small class of 'convenient' functions behave so that later we can see how calculus can be used to determine the behavior of arbitrary functions.

    <title>Power Functions</title>
    <p>
      Power functions are fundamental building blocks for many very useful functions. In their simplest form, power functions describe situations when the dependent variable is directly proportional to a power of the independent variable.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>power functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A power function has the form
          <me>
            f(x) = kx^{n}, \qquad \mbox{where }  k \mbox{ and }  n \mbox{ are constant.}
          </me>

      <image width="90%" source="images/0-6-fig2" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      For odd values of <m>n</m>, the graphs of <m>x^{n}</m> are always increasing. For even values of
      <m>n</m>, the graphs of <m>x^{n}</m> decrease until <m>x=0</m> and then increase afterwards. See <xref ref="F_0_6_Ex1">Figure</xref> for several examples of power functions. We can classify the <em>end
      behavior</em> of the graphs by describing what happens as <m>x\to\infty</m> and as <m>x\to-\infty</m>.
      For odd <m>n</m>, <m>x^{n}\to -\infty</m> as <m>x\to-\infty</m> and <m>x^{n}\to\infty</m> as <m>x\to\infty</m>.
      Graphs of odd power functions go in opposite directions on the left and right. For even
      <m>n</m>, <m>x^{n}\to \infty</m> as <m>x\to-\infty</m> and <m>x^{n}\to\infty</m> as <m>x\to\infty</m>. Graphs of
      even power functions go in the same direction on the left and right.

      When we study the graphs of functions, there are several common features we're interested in.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            How does the graph behave as <m>x\to\infty</m> and as <m>x\to-\infty</m>? (Does it grow without bound? Does it level off? Does it oscillate?)
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Where does the graph cross the <m>x</m>-axis? How many times?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Where does the graph change directions? How many times?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      For many functions, these questions can be difficult to answer and require specialized
      mathematics (like Calculus for example). For polynomials, though, there are some
      relatively simple results. First, the end behavior of a polynomial is determined by its
      degree and the sign of the lead coefficient. Polynomials with even degree behave like
      power functions with even degree, and polynomials with odd degree behave like power
      functions like odd degree. <xref ref="F_0_6_PolyEndBehavior">Figures</xref> and <xref ref="F_0_6_PolyEndBehavior2"></xref> demonstrate this for two different fourth degree polynomials.

                This function clearly has two roots and the ends show the same behavior.
                This indicates that this is likely a degree 2 polynomial (a quadratic).  Based
                on the roots <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=1</m> the factors are <m>(x+2)</m> and <m>(x-1)</m> so the
                polynomial is of the form <m>a(x) = C(x+2)(x-1)</m>.  Finally, it appears that the
                point <m>(-1,-4)</m> is on the curve so <m>C=2</m> and the polynomial is
                <me>
                  a(x) = 2(x+2)(x-1).
                </me>

            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                This function clearly has three roots and the ends show the opposite
                behavior.  Since the right-hand side of the function tends down we expect a
                negative leading coefficient.  Based on the roots <m>x=-2</m>, <m>x=1</m>, and <m>x=3</m> the
                factors are <m>(x+2)</m>, <m>(x-1)</m>, and <m>(x-3)</m> and the polynomial takes the form
                <m>b(x) = C(x+2)(x-1)(x-3)</m>.  The point <m>(-1,-8)</m> appears to be on the graph so
                <m>C = -1</m> and the polynomial is
                <me>
                  b(x) = -(x+2)(x-1)(x-3).
                </me>

            <li>
              <p>
                This function clearly has three roots but the end behavior indicates an even
                degree polynomial.  The root at <m>x=1</m> is special since we do not cross the <m>x</m>
                axis.  Hence, the factors are <m>(x+1)</m>, <m>(x-1)</m>, <m>(x-1)</m>, and <m>(x-2)</m>.  Notice
                that the <m>(x-1)</m> root is listed twice, and hence the polynomial takes the form
                <m>c(x) = C(x+1)(x-1)^2(x-2)</m>.  The point <m>(0,-2)</m> appears to be on the graph so
                <m>C = 1</m> and the polynomial is
                <me>
                  c(x) = (x+1)(x-1)^2(x-2).

                For <m>f(x) = x^2+3x+2</m> and <m>g(x) = x-3</m> when we form the function <m>h(x) =
                f(x)/g(x)</m> we get <m>h(x) = \frac{x^2+3x+2}{x-3}</m>.  Notice that <m>h(-1) = 0</m> and
                <m>h(-2) = 0</m> since <m>f(-1) = f(-2) = 0</m> and <m>g(-2) \neq 0</m>.  At <m>x=3</m>, on the
                other hand, <m>g(x) = 0</m> and there is a vertical asymptote on the function
                <m>h(x)</m>.

                For <m>k(x) = g(x) / f(x)</m>.  The vertical asymptotes occur at <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=-1</m>
                and a zero occurs at <m>x=3</m>.

              <p>
                For <m>f(x) = x^2-9</m> and <m>g(x) = x-3</m> we see immediately that <m>f(x)</m> can be
                factored to <m>f(x) = (x-3)(x+3)</m> and hence the function <m>h(x) = f(x)/g(x)</m>
                simplifies to <m>h(x) = x+3</m> when <m>x</m> is not <m>3</m>.  When <m>x=3</m> there is a
                discontinuity in the graph but this is not a vertical asymptote since the
                discontinuity can be removed algebraically.

                For <m>k(x) = g(x)/f(x)</m> we simplify to <m>k(x) = 1/(x+3)</m> when <m>x</m> is not <m>3</m>.
                Therefore there is a vertical asymptote at <m>x=-3</m> and a removable
                discontinuity at <m>x=3</m>.

          The degree of a polynomial function determines the end behavior of its graph.  If the degree of a polynomial is even, then the end behavior is the same in both directions.  If the degree of a polynomial is odd, then the end behavior on the left is the opposite of the behavior on the right.

          A rational function is a function of the form <m>f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}</m>, where <m>P(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m> are both polynomials.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>

          A rational function <m>f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}</m> may have a vertical asymptote whenever <m>Q(x)=0</m>.

          The end behavior of the graph of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator. (See <xref ref="A_0_6_4">Activity</xref>).
