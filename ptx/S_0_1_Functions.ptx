      We begin our study of calculus by reminding the reader of several pre-requisite topics.
      The study of calculus depends on a thorough understanding of these topics and it is
      imperative that the reader become as familiar as possible with these topics. In the
      present section we remind the reader about the concepts of functions, slope, and lines,
      but first, there are a few things that you should do to get your self ready to use this
      text.

  <subsection>
    <title>Functions</title>
    <p>
      Let's start with the fundamental mathematical idea of a function.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function is a mathematical rule that assigns exactly one output for every
          input.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      It is easy to give many common examples of functions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The area of a circle <m>A</m> is a function of the radius of the circle:  <m>A(r)= \pi r^2</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The amount <m>M</m> in your savings account is a function of the rate of interest the
            bank pays.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The fuel efficiency in your car is a function of many things, e.g. the speed at
            which you drive, the number of cylinders in your engine, the type of driving
            conditions, etc.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The pressure on a diver is a function of the depth of the diver under water.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>Domain of a Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The domain is the set of all possible inputs for a function.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <title>Range of a Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The range is the set of all possible outputs for a function.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the domain and range of the functions <m>f(x) = \sin(x), g(x) = \sqrt{x},</m> and <m>h(x) =
          \frac{1}{x}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      For <m>f(x)=\sin(x)</m> we recall that the sine function is defined for every possible value of <m>x</m> but
      the output is strictly between <m>y=-1</m> and <m>y=1</m>. Therefore, the domain for <m>f(x) =
      \sin(x)</m> is <m>-\infty \lt  x \lt  \infty</m> and the range is <m>-1 \le y \le 1</m>. See the left plot
      in <xref ref="f_0_1ex1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For <m>g(x) = \sqrt{x}</m> we recall that the square root of a negative number results in an
      imaginary number. In this text we are interested in real-valued output for functions so
      we must omit all of the negative numbers from the domain and hence <m>0 \le x \lt  \infty</m>.
      For the range we recall that the square root of a number will always be a non-negative
      number. As such, the range is <m>0 \le y \lt  \infty</m>. See the middle plot
      in <xref ref="f_0_1ex1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For <m>h(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> we recall that division by zero is mathematically impossible.
      That is the only troublesome point in the domain so <m>-\infty \lt  x \lt  0</m> or <m>0 \lt  x \lt  \infty</m>.
      A moment's reflection also reveals that it is impossible to get zero out of the function
      <m>h(x)</m> but it is possible to get any other number. Hence <m>-\infty \lt  y \lt  0</m> or <m>0 \lt  y \lt 
      \infty</m>. See the right plot in <xref ref="f_0_1ex1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="f_0_1ex1" >
      <caption>Graphs of the function <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>, <m>g(x) = \sqrt{x}</m>, and <m>h(x) =
      \frac{1}{x}</m>.</caption>
      <image width="95%" source="images/0-1-ex1.pdf" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      It is also important to recall the notation for functions. When we write <m>f(x) =
      \sqrt{x}</m> we are saying several things. First, the <q><m>f</m></q> is the name of the function
      that we're defining. The naming convention gives us a convenient way to refer to
      functions without having to explicitly state their algebraic form. Next, the <q><m>(x)</m></q> is
      an explicit statement to the reader that the variable <q><m>x</m></q> is the independent variable
      for the function <m>f</m>. Lastly, the right-hand side of the definition tells us exactly what
      to do with the independent variable algebraically.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we write <m>f(25)</m> we are referring to the already defined function <m>f</m> and explicitly
      saying to replace the independent variable with the number <m>25</m>. In this instance, <m>f(25)
      = \sqrt{25} = 5</m>. Similarly, if we write <m>f(\sin(x))</m> we mean to find the independent
      variable <m>x</m> in the function <m>f</m> and replace it with the function <m>\sin(x)</m>. In this
      case, <m>f(\sin(x)) = \sqrt{\sin(x)}</m>. This is simply a new function.
    </p>

    <p>
      A function does not always need to be given algebraically. The three primary
      representations of a function are the algebraic form, the graphical form, and the tabular
      form. For example, for the function <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x}</m> we are explicitly giving the
      algebraic form and the middle plot of <xref ref="f_0_1ex1">Figure</xref> shows the graphical form.
      <xref ref="t_0_1ex1">Table</xref> shows a portion of the table of values. The distinct disadvantage
      for a table of values on many functions is that there are infinitely many possible input
      values and a table can naturally only show finitely many of them.

    <title>Slope and Linear Functions</title>
    <p>
      One of the basic graphical ideas of calculus is that if we zoom in close enough to a
      curved function it will look approximately linear. The words <q>zoom</q> and <q>close
      enough</q> will be made explicit later. We now review the features of linear functions so
      that the idea of <q>zoomed in linearity</q> can flow naturally later in the course.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every linear function is characterized by a constant rate of change; the slope. The slope
      of a linear function is a measure of the <q>steepness</q> of the line. We use the symbols
      <m>\Delta x</m> and <m>\Delta y</m> which mean respectively the <q>change in <m>x</m></q> and the <q>change in
      <m>y</m></q>.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>slope</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The slope, <m>m</m> of a (non-vertical) linear function <m>f</m> which passes through any
          two points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m>, <m>(x_2,y_2)</m> can be found using the formula
          <me>
            m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} =
            \frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1} = \frac{\text{ Rise } }{\text{ Run } }
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      As shown in <xref ref="f_0_1slope">Figure</xref>, the slope of a linear function has the following characteristics:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            if the line rises from left to right then the slope is positive,
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            if the line falls from left to right then the slope is negative,
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            if the line is horizontal then the slope is zero, and
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            if the line is vertical then the slope is undefined.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="f_0_1slope" >
      <caption>Characteristics of slope.</caption>
      <image width="60%" source="images/0-1-fig3.pdf" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Depending on the information given there are several convenient forms of the equation of a
      line. Given the definition of the slope
      <me>
        m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
      </me>
      and letting <m>(x,y) = (x_2,y_2)</m> be any arbitrary point we get the point-slope form of a
      linear function by observing that <m>m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}</m> which implies
      that <m>y - y_1 = m(x-x_1)</m>.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>point-slope form of a line</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If the linear function <m>f</m> has slope <m>m</m> and passes through the
          point <m>(x_1,y_1)</m>, then the point-slope form of the equation of a line is given by:
          <me>
            y-y_1=m(x- x_1).
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      An alternate form of a linear function which is probably very familiar to most readers is
      the slope-intercept form of a line.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>slope intercept form of a line</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If the linear function <m>f</m> has slope <m>m</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>b</m>, then the
          slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is given by:
          <me>
            y=mx + b.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      In a calculus class the point-slope form is often the most useful. If you have a linear
      function written in the point-slope form you can always rearrange to get it into the
      slope-intercept form
      <me>
        y - y_1 = m(x-x_1)  \implies  y = mx - m x_1 + y_1.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence we see that the <m>y</m> intercept of a line can be given as <m>b = -mx_1 + y_1</m>.
      The
      symbols and geometry used in each of the above definitions are shown in <xref ref="fig_0_1_linear_fn">Figure</xref>.

              <p>
                The slope is <m>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{5-(-1)}{(-2)-10} =
                \frac{6}{-12} = -\frac{1}{2}</m>.  Hence,
                <me>
                  y - 5 = -\frac{1}{2} \left( x-(-2) \right)
                </me>
                which can be rewritten as
                <me>
                  y = -\frac{1}{2} \left( x+2 \right) + 5.
                </me>

            <li>
              <p>
                Using the point-slope form of the line we get
                <me>
                  y - 3 = \frac{3}{5} \left( x-2 \right)
                </me>
                which can be rearranged to
                <me>
                  y = \frac{3}{5} \left( x-2 \right) + 3.

            <li>
              <p>
                Using the slope-intercept form of the line we get
                <me>
                  y = -\frac{2}{3} x - 1.
                </me>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Write the equation of the line going through the points <m>(5,7)</m> and <m>(-3,2)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      First we calculate the slope
      <me>
        m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{7 - 2}{5-(-3)} = \frac{5}{8}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we have two points and neither is the <m>y</m> intercept of the linear function we choose
      to use the point-slope form of the line. Letting <m>(x_1,y_1) = (5,7)</m> we see that
      <me>
        y - 7 = \frac{5}{8} \left( x-5 \right)
      </me>
      is one form of the linear function.
      It is often conventient to solve for <m>y</m> giving us
      <me>
        y = \frac{5}{8} \left( x-5 \right) + 7.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that we do not necessarily need to simplify all the way to the slope-intercept form
      of the line.

    <title>Linear Functions From Data</title>
    <p>
      A feature of every linear function is that the slope is the same no matter where you are
      on the line. When given a table of data that you suspect might represent a linear
      function the slope manifests itself as a constant common difference between successive
      <m>y</m>-values.

      The successive differences are clearly the same throughout the data set and the slope for
      this data set is <m>m=5.3</m>. Picking any convenient point, say <m>(5,12.2)</m>, then allows us to write the
      equation of the line as
      <me>
        y - 12.2 = 5.3(x-5).
      </me>

    <p>
      This could be simplified to point-slope form, but there is typically no need for this
      algebraic simplification.

          The Old Farmer's Almanac tells us that you can tell the temperature by counting the chirps

          chirps in 15 seconds <m>+40</m>. We can approximate this with the formula
          <me>
            T =  \frac{C}{4} + 40
          </me>
          where <m>C</m> is the number of chirps/minute and <m>T</m> is in <m>^\circ F</m>.

            <li>

                Suppose that crickets will not chirp if the temperature is below <m>56^\circ F</m>.
                We can also suppose that crickets will not chirp above <m>136^\circ F</m> since that is
                the highest temperature ever recorded at a weather station.  With these

      <li>
        <p>
          To find the domain we need to find the appropriate values of <m>C</m> for the <m>T(C)</m>
          function.  Solve <m>56=C/4+40</m> and get <m>C = 64</m>.  Solve <m>136=C/4+40</m> and get <m>C =
          384</m>.  So the domain of <m>T(C)</m> is <m>64 \le \text{ chirps/minute }  \le 384</m> or, in
          interval notation, <m>[64, 136]</m>.

    <title>Families of Linear Functions</title>
    <p>
      We noted above that a linear function has the form <m>f(x)=mx+b</m>, where <m>m</m> is the slope of
      the line, and <m>b</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept. Since <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> can take on various values, taken
      together, they represent a family of functions. For example, we could fix <m>b = 2</m>, and then
      draw the graphs of <m>f(x)=mx+2</m> for various values of <m>m</m>; for example, <m>m = -1, -2, 2, 1</m>.
      Doing so would give the functions in the family <m>f(x)=mx+2</m> shown in the left image of <xref ref="fig_0_1_fam1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, we could set <m>m</m> to be <m>2</m> and let <m>b</m> take on the values <m>b=-1, 1, 4, -6</m> and
      we would get
      some examples from the family of functions for <m>y=f(x)=2x+b</m> shown in the right image of <xref ref="fig_0_1_fam1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the right image in <xref ref="fig_0_1_fam1">Figure</xref> it should be clear to the reader that
      parallel lines have the same slope. What can you say about the slopes of perpendicular
      lines? Here is the result that we state without proof.

            The independent variable is the number of years after 1960 so the <q>38</q> represents
            the year 1998. Hence, the phrase <q>The population of this city in the year 1998 is 8
