      The exponential function is a powerful tool in the mathematician's arsenal for modeling
      growth and decay phenomena. The common applications of the exponential funciton range
      from population modeling, to tracking drug levels in the blood stream, to using carbon
      dating to estimate the age of an artifact. The common mathematical fact about all of
      these situations is that the growth (or decay) rate is a constant multiple. For example,
      if we are measuring exponential population growth then the ratio of two successive
      populations must be constant. Linear functions have a similar behavior, except that in
      linear functions the difference (not the ratio) between two successive values is constant
      (the slope).

        Suppose that the populations of two towns are both growing over time. The town of
        Exponentia is growing at a rate of 2<percent /> per year, and the town of Lineola is growing at a
        rate of 100 people per year. In 2014, both of the towns have 2,000 people.

              example, dividing the population in 2015 by that of 2014 should give the same
              ratio as when the population from 2016 is divided by the population of 2015.  Find

      Consider the example where the population of a bacteria colony is doubling every week. If
      in the first week there are 100 bacteria, then there are 200 bacteria by the end of the
      second week, 400 by the end of the third and so on. In <xref ref="tab_0_2_bacteria">Table</xref> and
      Equation <xref ref="eqn_0_2_bacteria" /> we can see a simple way to model this type of growth.

    </md>
    <p>
      The time, <m>t</m> in equation <xref ref="eqn_0_2_bacteria" /> is measured in weeks. It is easy to see that
      the ratio of the populations for each successive week is constant at <m>P(t+1)/P(t) = 2</m>.
      This is indicative of exponential growth. Of course, this population growth could have
      been modeled using time measured in days instead. The population still doubles every week
      so for this new model the value at <m>t=7</m> should be double the value at <m>t=0</m>. Equation
      <xref ref="eqn_0_2_bacteria_days" /> shows this new model with only a slight modification
      adjusting for the new time measurement.
      <md>
        <mrow>P(t) = 100 \cdot 2^{t/7}  \text{ (\(t=\) number of days) }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      This type of modeling and thought process can be used to describe most exponential growth
      and decay situations. One
      general formula for an exponential function is
      <md>
        <mrow>f(x) = A \cdot r^{kx}.</mrow>
      </md>
      where <m>A</m> is some given initial value, <m>r</m> is the common ratio, and <m>k</m> is a constant
      given by the frequency in which the common ratio is applied. In the previous population
      doubling example, <m>A=100</m>, <m>r=2</m>, and <m>k=1/7</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few simple guidelines should make it clear when an exponential function is modeling
      growth or decay.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>r > 1</m> then the function exhibits exponential growth.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>0 \lt  r \lt  1</m> then the function exhibits exponential decay.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If a population is growing by <m>p\%</m> per unit time, then <m>r = 1+p/100</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If a population is decreasing by <m>p\%</m> per unit time, then <m>r = 1-p/100</m>.

          One application to exponential decay is to calculate the intensity of radiation from
          radioactive isotopes. Most isotopes emit particles and decay into stable forms. We
          measure the rate of decay from the particles by the isotope's half-life, which is
          how long it takes half of the isotope to decay. The half-life for Sodium-25 (<m>Na^{25}</m>)
          is almost exactly one minute. Write a function that models that amount of <m>Na^{25}</m> over
          time if you start with exactly 36 grams.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      If you begin with 36 grams of <m>Na^{25}</m> then the number of
      grams remaining after <m>t</m> minutes, <m>S(t)</m>, can be represented by the function
      <me>
        S(t) = 36 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{t},
      </me>
      where <m>t</m> is measured in minutes. <xref ref="F_0_2_Ex1">Figure</xref> shows this exponential decay

        Uncontrolled geometric growth of the bacterium <em>Escherichia coli (E. Coli)</em> is the
        theme of the following quote taken from the best-selling author Michael Crichton's
        science fiction thriller, <em>The Andromeda Strain:</em>
      </p>

      <blockquote>
      <q>The mathematics of uncontrolled growth are frightening.  A single cell of the
      bacterium E. coli would, under ideal circumstances, divide every twenty minutes.
      That is not particularly disturbing until you think about it, but the fact is that
      that bacteria multiply geometrically: one becomes two, two become four, four
      become eight, and so on.  In this way it can be shown that in a single day, one
      cell of E. coli could produce a super-colony equal in size and weight to the
      entire planet Earth.</q>

    <title>Investments</title>
    <p>
      Interest bearing bank accounts and investments follow exponential growth and decay models.
      In the case of a savings account the interest is typically compounded several times per
      year. This means that the investor is getting interest on their interest every time the
      bank computes the interest.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the money is gaining <m>p\%</m> interest compounded <m>n</m> times per year then the common ratio
      for the exponential function is <m>1 + p/n</m>. The exponent needs to reflect the fact that
      the interest occurs at monthly intervals. This means that the exponential function is
      <md>
        <mrow>A(t) = A_0 \left( 1+\frac{p}{n} \right)^{nt}  \text{ (\(t=\) number of years) } .</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      In Equation <xref ref="eqn_0_2_compound_interest" />, <m>A_0</m> is the initial investment, <m>A(t)</m> is
      the value of the investment over time, <m>p</m> is the interest rate, and <m>n</m> is the number of
      times the interest is compounded per year.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="x0_2_Ex2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <dollar />100 are invested into a bank account earning 2<percent /> interest compounded 12 times per
          year, how much does the investor have at the end of 1 year? 5 years? at retirement age?
          How does this change is we compound quarterly or daily instead of monthly?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      In the present situation the function modeling the value of the investment is
      <me>
        A(t) = 100 \left( 1 + \frac{0.02}{12} \right)^{12t}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      <xref ref="tab_0_2_ex2">Table</xref> shows the value of the investment over the first 5 years. It is
      clear that this is very slow growth, but it is exponential none the less. The common
      ratio in this case is <m>r = (1+0.02/12) \approx 1.0017</m>, and this means that you are really
      gaining 0.17<percent /> interest per month.

      Assume that our investor was an 18 year old and extrapolate this to retirement age,
      let's say 65 years old. That is 47 years worth of interest, and the initial <dollar />100
      investment becomes
      <me>
        A(47) = 100 \left( 1 + \frac{0.02}{12} \right)^{12\cdot 47} \approx \dollar256.

    </p>

    <p>
      If the number of times the bank compounds the interest changes the function will still
      have essentially the same form: <m>A(t) = 100 (1+\frac{0.02}{n})^{nt}</m>. In <xref ref="tab_0_2_ex2_n">Table</xref> the same investment is considered for several values of <m>n</m>. While
      more compoundings per year generally gives a higher rate of return on the investment, the
      impact is small for larger values of <m>n</m>.

    <title>Exponential Functions with Base <m>e</m></title>
    <p>
      Exponential functions are commonly written with a base of <m>e \approx 2.718281828459045\dots</m>.
      This may seem like an arbitrary and bizarre choice at first glance, but we will see that this famous
      number (called Euler's Number<fn>Euler's number is named after the famous <m>17^{th}</m>
      century mathematician Leonhard Euler. Euler was the first mathematician to introduce the
      notion of a function, and he is responsible for a large amount of the development of
      Calculus.</fn>) plays a central role in Calculus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Euler's number can be derived from Equation <xref ref="eqn_0_2_compound_interest" /> if we assume
      that a fictitious bank gives <m>100\%</m> interest compounded infinitely many times per year on
      a one dollar investment. Mathematically this is written as
      <md>
        <mrow>e = 1 \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \text{ as }  n \to \infty.</mrow>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A population of a city is 5000 people and is doubling in size every 5 years. Use
          equations <xref ref="eqn_0_2_exponential" /> and <xref ref="eqn_0_2_exponential_e" /> to write two
          different functions modeling this population; one with base 2 and one with base <m>e</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      If the population is doubling every 5 years we can use equation
      <xref ref="eqn_0_2_exponential" /> to write
      <me>
        P(t) = 5000 \cdot 2^{t/5}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to use equation <xref ref="eqn_0_2_exponential_e" /> we need to find the value of
      <q><m>k</m></q>. This is done by using the fact that at year 5 the population will be 10000 and
      solving the equation
      <me>
        10000 = 5000 \cdot e^{5k}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Rearranging we see that <m>e^{5k} = 2</m>. In order to solve this algebraic equation we need
      to use logarithms. These important functions will be discussed in more detail in the
      logarithms section
      In this case we see that <m>k = \ln(2) / 5 \approx 0.139.</m>
      Therefore,
      <me>
        P(t) = 5000 \cdot e^{0.139 t}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since these two equations model the same population they must be identical. Indeed,
      <me>
        5000 \cdot 2^{t/5} = 5000 \cdot \left( 2^{1/5} \right)^t \approx 5000 \cdot (1.149)^t,
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        5000 \cdot e^{kt} = 5000 \cdot \left( e^k \right)^t \approx 5000 \cdot (1.149)^t.
