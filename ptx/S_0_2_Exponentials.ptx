        Suppose that the populations of two towns are both growing over time. The town of
        Exponentia is growing at a rate of 2<percent /> per year, and the town of Lineola is growing at a
        rate of 100 people per year. In 2014, both of the towns have 2,000 people.

              The ratio of successive populations for Exponentia should be equal.  For
              example, dividing the population in 2015 by that of 2014 should give the same
              ratio as when the population from 2016 is divided by the population of 2015.  Find
              this ratio.  How is this ratio related to the 2<percent /> growth rate?

        Uncontrolled geometric growth of the bacterium <em>Escherichia coli (E. Coli)</em> is the
        theme of the following quote taken from the best-selling author Michael Crichton's
        science fiction thriller, <em>The Andromeda Strain:</em>
      </p>

      <blockquote>
      <q>The mathematics of uncontrolled growth are frightening.  A single cell of the
      bacterium E. coli would, under ideal circumstances, divide every twenty minutes.
      That is not particularly disturbing until you think about it, but the fact is that
      that bacteria multiply geometrically: one becomes two, two become four, four
      become eight, and so on.  In this way it can be shown that in a single day, one
      cell of E. coli could produce a super-colony equal in size and weight to the
      entire planet Earth.</q>
