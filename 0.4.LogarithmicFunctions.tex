\subsection*{Introduction}

In section \ref{S:0.2.Exponentials} we studied exponential functions to model a
variety of different settings.  It is straightforward to verify that the graph of an
exponential function passes the ``horizontal line test'' described in section
\ref{S:0.3.Transformations}, and so we should expect exponential functions to have
corresponding inverse functions.  In this section we will define the \emph{logarithm} to
be the inverse function for an exponential.

\subsection*{Logarithms}

\begin{definition}
Let $b>0$ with $b\neq1$. The \textbf{logarithm of }$x$ \textbf{with base }$b$ is defined by
	\[
		\log_{b}x=y\qquad\mbox{if and only if}\qquad x=b^{y}.
	\]
The expression $\log_{b}x$ represents the power to which $b$ needs to be raised in order to get $x$.

Two frequently used logarithmic functions are $\log_{10}x$ (frequently written $\log x$) and the natural logarithm $\log_{e}x$ (frequently written $\ln x$).
\end{definition}

Note that we have specifically defined logarithms to be inverse functions for
exponentials. For instance, $\log_{10}{1000} = 3$, since $10^{3} = 1000$.  Logarithmic
functions give us a way to re-write exponential expressions and, more importantly, solve
equations involving variables in an exponent.

\subsection*{Properties of Logarithms}
Since logarithms and exponentials are inverse functions, many of the properties of
logarithmic functions can be deduced directly from the properties of exponential
functions.  For example, the domain of all logarithmic functions is $(0,\infty)$ and the
range of all logarithmic functions is $(-\infty,\infty)$ because those are the range and
domain, respectively, of exponential functions.  Similarly, logarithmic functions have a
vertical asymptote at $x = 0$ because exponential functions have a horizontal asymptote at
$y = 0$. These features can be seen in Figure \ref{F:0.4.Ex1}.

The following properties of logarithms can be deduced from the properties of exponential functions and the definition of the logarithm.  These properties are especially useful in simplifying or solving logarithmic and exponential equations.
% \begin{callout}

\noindent {\bf Properties of logarithms:} For $b>0$, $b \ne 1$, and $x,y>0$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\log_{b}1=0$
\item $\log_{b}b=1$
\item $\log_{b}\left(xy\right)=\log_{b}x+\log_{b}y$
\item $\log_{b}\left(\dfrac{x}{y}\right)=\log_{b}x-\log_{b}y$
\item $\log_{b}x^{r}=r\,\log_{b}x$
\item $\log_{b}b^{x}=x$
\item $b^{\log_{b}x}=x$
\item $\log_{b}x=\log_{b}y$ if and only if $x=y$
\item $\log_a b = \frac{\log_c a}{\log_c b}$ (this is called the change of base formula)
\end{enumerate}
% \end{callout}

Euler's number, $e$, shows up so often that we give a special name to the associated
logarithm.  The logarithm $\log_e (x)$ is called the natural logarithm and is written as
$\ln(x)$.  We will see later in this course that the exponential function $f(x) = e^x$ has
very special calculus properties and as such the natural logarithm has very special
properties as well.  With this in mind, most mathematicians and scientists use $e^x$ and
$\ln(x)$ as their preferred exponential and logarithmic functions.

Find a value of $x$ for which $3^{x}=13$.
\eex
To isolate the variable $x$, we should take the logarithm of both sides. For convenience,
let's choose to use the natural logarithm.
	\[
		\ln(3^{x})=\ln(13).
	\]
Applying logarithm property (5), we find
	\[
		x\,\ln 3=\ln 13.
	\]
Solving algebraically for $x$ yields
	\[
		x=\frac{\ln 13}{\ln 3}\approx2.3347.
	\]
NOTE: Our choice to use the natural logarithm was arbitrary. We could have chosen any base
for our logarithm to solve this equation.

In 1970, the population of the United States was approximately 205.1 million people. Since
that time, the population has grown at a continuous growth rate of approximately 1.05\%. Assuming that this growth rate continues, when would we expect the population of the United States to reach 350 million?
\eex
Since the rate of growth of the population is proportional to the size of the population, we should use an exponential model for this problem. That is, we want
	\[
		P(t)=P_{0}e^{rt}
	\]
where $t$ is the number of years after 1970, $P(t)$ is the population (in millions) of the
United States at time $t$, $P_{0}$ is the population (in millions) of the United States in
1970 (i.e. $t=0$) and $r$ is the continuous rate of growth of the population. To determine when the population will reach 350 million, we must solve the equation 
	\[
		350=205.1e^{0.0105t}.
	\]
To solve for $t$, we need to first solve for the exponential expression by itself and then use logarithms. Dividing both sides of the equation by 205.1 gives
	\[
		\frac{350}{205.1}=e^{0.0105t}.
	\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives
	\[
		\ln\left(\frac{350}{205.1}\right)=\ln\left(e^{0.0105t}\right).
	\]
Applying logarithm property (6), we find
	\[
		\ln\left(\frac{350}{205.1}\right)=0.0105t.
	\]
Finally, solving algebraically for $t$ gives
	\[
		t=\frac{1}{0.0105}\ln\left(\frac{350}{205.1}\right)\approx50.9\,\mbox{years}.
	\]
Thus, we expect the population of the United States to reach 350 million in 2021 (approximately 51 years after 1970).
