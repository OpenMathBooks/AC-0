A tall water tower is swaying back and forth in the wind. Using an ultrasonic ranging
device, we measure the distance from our device to the tower (in centimeters) every two seconds with these measurements recorded below.

    (a) Start by plotting the points on graph paper. $BR
    (b) What is the water tower's maximum distance away from the device? \{ ans_rule(10) \}
    $BR
    (c) What is the smallest distance measured from the tower to the device? \{ ans_rule(10) \} $BR
    (d) If the water tower was sitting still and no wind was blowing, what would be the distance from the tower to the device? We call this the towerâ€™s equilibrium position.  \{ ans_rule(10) \}
    $BR
    (e) What is the maximum distance that the tower moves away from its equilibrium position? We call this the amplitude of the oscillations. \{ ans_rule(10) \}
    $BR
    (f) How much time does it take the water tower to sway back and forth in a complete cycle? We call this the period of oscillation. \{ ans_rule(10) \}
