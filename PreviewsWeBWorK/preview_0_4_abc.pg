Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that occurs naturally in the
Earthâ€™s atmosphere. During photosynthesis, plants take in Carbon-14 along with other carbon isotopes, and the levels of Carbon-14 in living plants are roughly the same as atmospheric levels. Once a plant dies, it no longer takes in any additional Carbon-14. Since Carbon-14 in the dead plant decays at a predictable rate (the half-life of Carbon-14 is approximately 5,730 years), we can measure Carbon-14 levels in dead plant matter to get an estimate on how long ago the plant died.
Suppose that a plant has 0.02 milligrams of Carbon-14 when it dies.
$PAR
(a) Write a function that represents the amount of Carbon-14 remaining in the plant after \(x\) years. $BR
\(C(x) = \) \{ans_rule(15)\} $BR
(b) Complete the table for the amount of Carbon-14 remaining \(x\) years after the death of the plant.

    (c) Suppose a plant died sometime in the past. If we find that there are 0.014 milligrams of Carbon-14 present in the plant now, estimate the age of the plant to within 50 years. (you can complete this problem graphically) \{ ans_rule(10)\}
