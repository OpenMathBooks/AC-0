{\it Answer: (d).}  This question is intended to help students think about how operations on function can change the graph; in this case the operations being translation and reflection.  In this case, the order in which the actions are taken is important.  Students might be encouraged to graph the results of doing the operations in the incorrect order and to give the equation which correctly describes doing operations in that order.
