{\it Answer:  (c).} Students will need to first write an equation appropriate for a continuous decay rate, $f(t)=Ae^{-.17t}$ and then evaluate it when $A=100$ and $t=8$.  Choice b is the value if the given rate is used as an annual decay rate.  Choice a is the value if the value using continuous growth instead (omission of - sign).
