\item Given the graph of a function $f(x)$, what sequence of activities best describes the process you might go through to graph $g(x) = -f(x)+2$?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Move the graph up 2 units, then reflect it across the $x$-axis.
\item Move the graph up 2 units, then reflect it across the $y$-axis.
\item Reflect the graph across the $y$-axis, then move it up by 2 units.
\item Reflect the graph across the $x$-axis, then move it up 2 units.
\item More than 1 of the above.
\item None of the above.
\end{enumerate}
