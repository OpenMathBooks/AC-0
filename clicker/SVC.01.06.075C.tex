{\it Answer: (c).}  This question is intended to test the definition of even function.  Here, only (c) is correct as it is a polynomial with all even powers.  Answer (a) may be tempting, and students should be encouraged to give a counter-example (such as $f(x) = x^2 + x$) if this emerges as a serious contender in the discussion.
