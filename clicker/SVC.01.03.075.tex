\item Given the graph of a function $f(x)$, what sequence of activities best describes the process you might go through to graph $g(x) = 5f(-x)$?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Expand the graph by a factor of 5, then reflect it across the $y$-axis.
\item Expand the graph by a factor of 5, then reflect it across the $x$-axis.
\item Reflect the graph across the $y$-axis, then expand it by a factor of 5.
\item Reflect the graph across the $x$-axis, then expand it by a factor of 5.
\item More than 1 of the above.
\item None of the above.
\end{enumerate}
