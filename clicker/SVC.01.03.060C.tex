{\it Answer: (b).} II.  This graph appears shifted to the left by one unit and thus could be $f(x+1)$.  A good follow-up question is to ask what transformation could produce the other 3 graphs.  Graph I is produced by $f(x) - 1$, graph III is produced by $-\frac{1}{2} f(x)$, and graph IV is produced by $2f(x)$.
