\item 25 rabbits are introduced to an island, where they quickly reproduce and the rabbit population grows according to an exponential model $P(t) = P_0 e^{kt}$ so that the population doubles every four months.  If $t$ is in months, what is the value of the continuous growth rate $k$?

\begin{enumerate}
\item $k = \frac{1}{2} \ln 4$
\item $k = \frac{1}{4} \ln 2$
\item $k = \frac{1}{50} \ln \frac{4}{25}$
\item $k = \frac{4}{25} \ln \frac{1}{50}$
\item None of the above
\end{enumerate}
