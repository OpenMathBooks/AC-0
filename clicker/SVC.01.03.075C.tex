{\it Answer: (e).}  Both (a) and (c) are correct.  This question is intended to help students think about how operations on function can change the graph; in this case the operations being scaling and reflection.  In this case, they also have to think about whether it makes a difference if you expand or reflect first.  You can expand and reflect in any order without changing the result.  This should be contrasted with the next question, where it does make a difference which operation is done first.
