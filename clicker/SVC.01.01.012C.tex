{\it Answer: (Yes).} If I know my age, I can uniquely determine Wanda's age. Then ask students to write a formula for this function and give the domain and range. So if my age is $m$ and Wanda's age is $W$, then Wanda's age is $W = m + 2$. Also, my age as a function of Wanda's age is $m = f (W) = W - 2$.
