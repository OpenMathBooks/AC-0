\begin{activity}\label{A:0.2.2}
    A sample of $Ni^{56}$ has a half-life of 6.4 days.  Assume that there are 30 grams
    present initially.
    \ba
        \item Write a function describing the number of grams of $Ni^{56}$ present as a
            function of time.  Check your function based on the fact that in 6.4 days
            there should be 50\% remaining.
        \item What percent of the substance is present after 1 day?
        \item What percent of the substance is present after 10 days?
