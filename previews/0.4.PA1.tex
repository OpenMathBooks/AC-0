	Carbon-14 ($^{14}$C) is a radioactive isotope of carbon that occurs naturally in the Earth's atmosphere.  During photosynthesis, plants take in $^{14}$C along with other carbon 	isotopes, and the levels of  $^{14}$C in living plants are roughly the same as atmospheric levels.  Once a plant dies, it no longer takes in any additional  $^{14}$C.  Since  $^{14}$C in the dead plant decays at a predictable rate (the half-life of $^{14}$C is approximately 5,730 years), we can measure  $^{14}$C levels in dead plant matter to get an estimate on how long ago the plant 	died.
	Suppose that a plant has 0.02 milligrams of $^{14}$C when it dies.

	\item Write a function that represents the amount of $^{14}$C remaining in the plant after $t$ years.
	\item Complete the table for the amount of $^{14}$C remaining $t$ years after the death of the plant.

            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
	\item Suppose our plant died sometime in the past.  If we find that there are 0.014 milligrams of $^{14}$C present in the plant now, estimate the age of the plant to within 50 years.
