\begin{pa} \label{PA:0.2}
Suppose that the populations of two towns are both growing over time.  The town of
Exponentia is growing at a rate of 2\% per year, and the town of Lineola is growing at a
rate of 100 people per year.  In 2014, both of the towns have 2,000 people.
\ba
    \item Complete the table for the population of each of these towns over the next
        several years.
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}[h!]{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
                \hline
                & 2014 & 2015 & 2016 & 2017 & 2018 & 2019 & 2020 & 2021 & 2022 \\ \hline
                Exponentia & 2000 & & & & & & & & \\ \hline
                Lineola &  2000 & & & & & & & & \\ \hline
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
    \item Write a linear function for the population of Lineola. Interpret the slope in
        the context of this problem.
    \item The ratio of successive populations for Exponentia should be equal.  For
        example, dividing the population in 2015 by that of 2014 should give the same
        ratio as when the population from 2016 is divided by the population of 2015.  Find
        this ratio.  How is this ratio related to the 2\% growth rate?
    \item Based on your data from part (a) and your ratio in part (c), write a function
        for the population of Exponentia.
    \item When will the population of Exponentia exceed that of Lineola?
