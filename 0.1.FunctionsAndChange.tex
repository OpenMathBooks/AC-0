\subsection*{Introduction}
We begin our study of calculus by reminding the reader of several pre-requisite topics.
The study of calculus depends on a thorough understanding of these topics and it is
imperative that the reader become as familiar as possible with these topics.  In the
present section we remind the reader about the concepts of functions, slope, and lines,
but first, there are a few things that you should do to get your self ready to use this
text.

\input{previews/0.1.PA1}

\subsection*{Functions}
Let's start with the fundamental mathematical idea of a function.  
\begin{definition}[Function]
    A function is a mathematical rule that assigns exactly one output for every
    input.  
\end{definition}

It is easy to give many common examples of functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The area of a circle $A$ is a function of the radius of the circle:  $A(r)= \pi r^2$.
    \item The amount $M$ in your savings account is a function of the rate of interest the
        bank pays.
    \item The fuel efficiency in your car is a function of many things, e.g. the speed at
        which you drive, the number of cylinders in your engine, the type of driving
        conditions, etc.
    \item The pressure on a diver is a function of the depth of the diver under water.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Domain of a Function]
    The domain is the set of all possible inputs for a function.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Range of a Function]
    The range is the set of all possible outputs for a function.
\end{definition}

\bex
Find the domain and range of the functions $f(x) = \sin(x), g(x) = \sqrt{x},$ and $h(x) =
    \frac{1}{x}$.
\eex
For $f(x)=\sin(x)$ we recall that the sine function is defined for every possible value of $x$ but
the output is strictly between $y=-1$ and $y=1$.  Therefore, the domain for $f(x) =
\sin(x)$ is $-\infty < x < \infty$ and the range is $-1 \le y \le 1$.  See the left plot
in Figure \ref{f:0.1ex1}.

For $g(x) = \sqrt{x}$ we recall that the square root of a negative number results in an
imaginary number.  In this text we are interested in real-valued output for functions so
we must omit all of the negative numbers from the domain and hence $0 \le x < \infty$.
For the range we recall that the square root of a number will always be a non-negative
number.  As such, the range is $0 \le y < \infty$.  See the middle plot
in Figure \ref{f:0.1ex1}.

For $h(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ we recall that division by zero is mathematically impossible.
That is the only troublesome point in the domain so $-\infty < x < 0$ or $0 < x < \infty$.
A moment's reflection also reveals that it is impossible to get zero out of the function
$h(x)$ but it is possible to get any other number.  Hence $-\infty < y < 0$ or $0 < y <
\infty$. See the right plot in Figure \ref{f:0.1ex1}.

\end{figure}

% It is often convenient to examine functions graphically instead of algebraically.  In our
% previous example we 
% 
% Probably the most common method for representing a function is with a graph.  If the
% domain of function $f$ is set $A$, then the graph of $f$ is the collection of all ordered
% pairs of the form $(x,f(x))$ where $x$ comes from the domain $A$.

It is also important to recall the notation for functions.  When we write $f(x) =
\sqrt{x}$ we are saying several things.  First, the ``$f$'' is the name of the function
that we're defining.  The naming convention gives us a convenient way to refer to
functions without having to explicitly state their algebraic form.  Next, the ``$(x)$'' is
an explicit statement to the reader that the variable ``$x$'' is the independent variable
for the function $f$.  Lastly, the right-hand side of the definition tells us exactly what
to do with the independent variable algebraically.  

When we write $f(25)$ we are referring to the already defined function $f$ and explicitly
saying to replace the independent variable with the number $25$.  In this instance, $f(25)
= \sqrt{25} = 5$.  Similarly, if we write $f(\sin(x))$ we mean to find the independent
variable $x$ in the function $f$ and replace it with the function $\sin(x)$.  In this
case, $f(\sin(x)) = \sqrt{\sin(x)}$.  This is simply a new function.

A function does not always need to be given algebraically.  The three primary
representations of a function are the algebraic form, the graphical form, and the tabular
form.  For example, for the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ we are explicitly giving the
algebraic form and the middle plot of Figure \ref{f:0.1ex1} shows the graphical form.
Table \ref{t:0.1ex1} shows a portion of the table of values.  The distinct disadvantage
for a table of values on many functions is that there are infinitely many possible input
values and a table can naturally only show finitely many of them.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        $x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline
        $f(x)$ & 0 & 1 & 1.414 & 1.732 & 2 & 2.236 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Tabular form of the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$.}
    \label{t:0.1ex1}
\end{table}


\input{activities/0.1.Act1}



\subsection*{Slope and Linear Functions}
One of the basic graphical ideas of calculus is that if we zoom in close enough to a
curved function it will look approximately linear.  The words ``zoom'' and ``close
enough'' will be made explicit later.  We now review the features of linear functions so
that the idea of ``zoomed in linearity'' can flow naturally later in the course.  

Every linear function is characterized by a constant rate of change; the slope.  The slope
of a linear function is a measure of the ``steepness'' of the line.  We use the symbols
$\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ which mean respectively the ``change in $x$'' and the ``change in
$y$''.  
\begin{definition}[slope]
    The slope, $m$ of a (non-vertical) linear function $f$ which passes through any
    two points $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$ can be found using the formula
    \[ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} =
    \frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1} = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}} \]
\end{definition}

As shown in Figure \ref{f:0.1slope}, the slope of a linear function has the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item if the line rises from left to right then the slope is positive,
    \item if the line falls from left to right then the slope is negative,
    \item if the line is horizontal then the slope is zero, and
    \item if the line is vertical then the slope is undefined.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}

%             \draw[<->, very thick, blue] (-4,3) -- (4,-1) node[anchor=west]{Negative
%             Slope};
%             \draw[<->, very thick, color=red, dashed] (-4,-2) -- (4,3)
%             node[anchor=west]{Positive Slope};
%             \draw[<->, very thick, color=black, dotted] (-4,2) -- (4,2)
%             node[anchor=west]{Zero Slope};
%         \end{tikzpicture}
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{figures/0-1-fig3.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Characteristics of slope.}
    \label{f:0.1slope}
\end{figure}

Depending on the information given there are several convenient forms of the equation of a
line.  Given the definition of the slope
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]
and letting $(x,y) = (x_2,y_2)$ be any arbitrary point we get the point-slope form of a
linear function by observing that $m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}$ which implies
that $y - y_1 = m(x-x_1)$.
\begin{definition}[point-slope form of a line]
If the linear function $f$ has slope $m$ and passes through the
point $(x_1,y_1)$, then the point-slope form of the equation of a line is given by: 
\[ y-y_1=m(x- x_1).  \]
\end{definition}

An alternate form of a linear function which is probably very familiar to most readers is
the slope-intercept form of a line.
\begin{definition}[slope intercept form of a line]
If the linear function $f$ has slope $m$ and $y$-intercept $b$, then the
slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is given by: 
\[ y=mx + b.  \]
\end{definition}
In a calculus class the point-slope form is often the most useful.  If you have a linear
function written in the point-slope form you can always rearrange to get it into the
slope-intercept form
\[ y - y_1 = m(x-x_1) \quad \implies \quad y = mx - m x_1 + y_1. \]
Hence we see that the $y$ intercept of a line can be given as $b = -mx_1 + y_1$.
The
symbols and geometry used in each of the above definitions are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:0.1.linear_fn}.

\bex
Write the equation of the line going through the points $(5,7)$ and $(-3,2)$.
\eex
First we calculate the slope 
\[ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{7 - 2}{5-(-3)} = \frac{5}{8}. \]
Since we have two points and neither is the $y$ intercept of the linear function we choose
to use the point-slope form of the line.  Letting $(x_1,y_1) = (5,7)$ we see that
\[ y - 7 = \frac{5}{8} \left( x-5 \right) \]
is one form of the linear function.  
It is often conventient to solve for $y$ giving us
\[ y = \frac{5}{8} \left( x-5 \right) + 7. \]
Notice that we do not necessarily need to simplify all the way to the slope-intercept form
of the line.

\subsection*{Linear Functions From Data}
A feature of every linear function is that the slope is the same no matter where you are
on the line.  When given a table of data that you suspect might represent a linear
function the slope manifests itself as a constant common difference between successive
$y$-values.  

\bex
Consider the data in the table below.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}[h!]{|c||c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        $x$ & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ \hline
        $y$ & 12.2 & 17.5 & 22.8 & 28.1 & 33.4 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Demonstrate that this data is linear and write an equation that fits the data.
\eex
The common differences can be found for each successive $y$-values
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}[h!]{|c||c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        $x$ & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ \hline
        $y$ & 12.2 & 17.5 & 22.8 & 28.1 & 33.4 \\ \hline
        Common Difference & $\frac{17.5-12.2}{6-5} = 5.3$ & $\frac{22.8-17.5}{7-6} = 5.3$
        & $\frac{28.1-22.8}{8-7} = 5.3$ & $\frac{33.4-28.1}{9-8}=5.3$ & - \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
The successive differences are clearly the same throughout the data set and the slope for
this data set is $m=5.3$.  Picking any convenient point, say $(5,12.2)$, then allows us to write the
equation of the line as 
\[ y - 12.2 = 5.3(x-5). \]
This could be simplified to point-slope form, but there is typically no need for this
algebraic simplification.

The Old Farmer's Almanac tells us that you can tell the temperature by counting the chirps
of a cricket.  It is a linear function $T=f(C)$ given by $T$ (in degrees Fahrenheit)=\# of
chirps in 15 seconds $+40$.  We can approximate this with the formula 
\[ T =  \frac{C}{4} + 40 \]
where $C$ is the number of chirps/minute and $T$ is in $^\circ F$.
\ba
    \item If the chirp rate is 120 chirps/minute, what is the temperature?
    \item Suppose that crickets will not chirp if the temperature is below $56^\circ F$.
        We can also suppose that crickets will not chirp above $136^\circ F$ since that is
        the highest temperature ever recorded at a weather station.  With these
        parameters, what is the domain of this function?
\ea
\eex
\ba
    \item If $C = 120$ chirps/minute, substitute this into the function $T(C)$ to obtain
        \[ T(120) = \frac{120}{4} + 40 = 30 + 40 = 70^\circ F. \]
    \item To find the domain we need to find the appropriate values of $C$ for the $T(C)$
        function.  Solve $56=C/4+40$ and get $C = 64$.  Solve $136=C/4+40$ and get $C =
        384$.  So the domain of $T(C)$ is $64 \le \text{chirps/minute} \le 384$ or, in
        interval notation, $[64, 136]$. 

\ea

\subsection*{Families of Linear Functions}
We noted above that a linear function has the form  $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of
the line, and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.  Since $m$ and $b$ can take on various values, taken
together, they represent a family of functions.  For example, we could fix $b = 2$, and then
draw the graphs of $f(x)=mx+2$ for various values of $m$; for example, $m = -1, -2, 2, 1$.
Doing so would give the functions in the family $f(x)=mx+2$ shown in the left image of Figure
\ref{fig:0.1.fam1}.

Similarly, we could set $m$ to be $2$ and let $b$ take on the values $b=-1, 1, 4, -6$ and
we would get
some examples from the family of functions for $y=f(x)=2x+b$ shown in the right image of Figure
\ref{fig:0.1.fam1}.


From the right image in Figure \ref{fig:0.1.fam1} it should be clear to the reader that
parallel lines have the same slope.  What can you say about the slopes of perpendicular
lines?  Here is the result that we state without proof.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:test}
If line $\ell_1$ has slope $m_1$ and line $\ell_2$ has slope $m_2$, then 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are parallel if the slopes are the same: $m_1 = m_2$,
            and
        \item lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are perpendicular if the slopes are opposite
            reciprocals: $m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1}$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
